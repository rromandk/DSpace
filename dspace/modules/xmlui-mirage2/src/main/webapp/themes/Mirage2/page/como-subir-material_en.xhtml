	<h2>¿How to upload material?</h2>
	<p>If you are a researcher or teacher at the Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos or have been in the past, you can contribute your works to the RIUNER repository by performing a simple procedure called self-archiving. The same can be done from anywhere with internet access and allows you to send the material in digital. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="/login">Login</a> to the site, if you are not yet a user, you can <a href="/register">register here</a>.</li>
		<li>Access the <a href="/submissions">"Submissions"</a> section. Once there, the system will guide you through a series of simple steps.</li>
		<li>Complete a form with the data of the work to be added.</li>
		<li>Choose the relevant license of use.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Once RIUNER receives the material after a brief check, it will be published in the repository and you will be duly notified.</p>
